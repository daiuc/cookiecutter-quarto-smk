# cookiecutter-quarto-workflow

Cookiecutter template for snakemake workflows and quarto website project documentation. This project template is inspired by this [cookiecutter snakemake project template](https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/cookiecutter-snakemake-workflow) and the suggested project structure for [workflowr](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/articles/wflow-01-getting-started.html) R package for creating a static site from Rmarkdown files. I use the project template as follows:

### USAGE

Install cookiecutter:

```
pip install cookiecutter
```

Start creating a snakemake-workflow from cookiecutter:
```
